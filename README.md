# Finance Technical Skills Portfolio

Welcome! 👋\
This repository is my learning space for building and improving technical skills that are valuable in **finance, data analysis, and problem-solving.**

I’ll be working through projects using:
- **Python** 🐍 (data analysis, automation, financial modelling)
- **VBA** (Excel automation and reporting)
- **SQL** (data querying and database management)
- **Excel** (advanced formulas, dashboards, modelling)

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this portfolio is to:
1. Strengthen my programming and data skills.
2. Apply these tools to finance-focused projects (valuation, risk analysis, portfolio optimisation, reporting automation, etc.).
3. Build a structured collection of work that demonstrates both technical ability and financial understanding.
